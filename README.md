# Matterhorn
A Celeste 64/Fuji Mod Manager

This program will help to manage [Fuji](https://github.com/FujiAPI/Fuji/releases) installations and their respective mods.
This is NOT finished yet.

This uses the [NativeDialogs](https://github.com/98teg/NativeDialogs/) library for some things. I don't really know if MIT requires attribution but I might as well credit them, right?
